Introduction: 

The Snake Game is a visually enhanced version of the classic snake arcade game developed using Python’s turtle graphics. The game challenges players to control a snake that moves in zigzag patterns to collect multiple apples while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. Features like animated eyes, a flickering tongue, gradient backgrounds, and multiple food items make the gameplay more engaging and fun. This project demonstrates Python programming skills in real-time animation, event handling via keyboard controls, collision detection, and score management.

Project Objective Statement:

The objective of this project is to build an interactive and user-friendly Snake Game using Python's turtle module that showcases smooth animation and responsive controls. The game aims to:
Implement movement controls to navigate the snake in four directions with a unique zigzag motion pattern.
Manage multiple food items for increased challenge and score opportunities.
Track and display both current and high scores to motivate players.
Include visual enhancements such as gradient backgrounds, snake eyes, and tongue animation to improve user experience.
Strengthen understanding of graphical rendering, event-driven programming, collision detection, and dynamic updates using Python.
This project serves as both an entertaining game and a practical learning exercise in Python game development.
