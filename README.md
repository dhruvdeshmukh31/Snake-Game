# Snake-Game
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The goal is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake’s own body while collecting food. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging, requiring quick reflexes and strategic movement to survive and score high.
